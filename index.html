<p><strong><span>Experience:</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Jul 2018 to Present:</em> <h4>International Organisation of Software Developers</h4>
<strong>Founder: IOSD SRM</strong>
Opened a chapter of IOSD in my college: SRM NCR. IOSD, International Organisation of Software Developers is the
largest development based student organization in North India. IOSD is the only student-organization that is
completely development oriented. At first, students are given interactive technical sessions by senior members so
that all the students can get familiar with the new development culture. Then, projects are given in teams so that
they can acquaint themselves with the requirements of working in a team, as well as get going and start developing
on their own!</p>
